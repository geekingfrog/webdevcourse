# Small web dev classes

I use [csss](http://lea.verou.me/csss/#intro) for the slides.
Withount any pretention, this is a small classes I'm giving to a friend to learn the basis of web development. His goal is to be able to create his own basic mockup and prototype, and be able to communicate more efficiently with a potential technical co-founder/cto/nerdy colleague.
